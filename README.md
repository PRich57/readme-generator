# README Generator

## Description

  - To create a quick and easy to use README Generator
  - To remove the hassle of creating my own README generator when I'd rather focus on the actual project
  - This project removes the need to spend precious time creating a README file for every project by creating one for you based on your responses
  - I learned how to create a command line application
  - I plan to implement a way to add a mock-up image to the readme in the future
