# README Generator

  ![404 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/No_License_Chosen-red)

## Description

  - The motivation for this project was to create an application that generates professional README.md files for future projects so more time can be spent on the project itself.
  - I built this project to gain knowledge on creating command line applications and to provide myself, or any other user, with a tool that will help generate a professional README.md file by answering questions about their project. 
  - Using this tool on future projects will save time that could be better used on the project itself rather than setting time aside to plan out and format a README.md file from scratch.
  - I learned how to use node, npm, and inquirer to create a user friendly command line application that takes user input and utilizes it for a practical, reusable application.
  - In the future I plan to implement more licensing options as well as  a way to add screenshots of the project for a 'Mock-Up' section.

## Installation
  
  The installation of this project requires the user to install node from https://nodejs.org and to use 'npm i' to install the correct version of inquirer from the dependencies.
  
## Usage
  
  To use this command line application, the user must navigate to the directory containing the index.js file and run the command "node index.js". The user will then need to answer the questions in the command line as they appear. When each question has been answered, the user will be notified whether the responses have been successfully written to a formatted README.md in the output directory or if there was an error. If the program was completed successfully, the user will need to navigate to the output directory within the current working directory to view and copy their newly created README.md file.
